While the Caliphate has long been a republic, where the caliph serves as a symbol of unity and the council governs with the people's voice, a growing faction of theologians and traditionalists now calls for a shift toward a Theocratic Caliphate.This faction argues that divine law must take precedence, with the caliph serving not only as a political leader but as the ultimate spiritual guide. They promise moral clarity and divine blessings but demand the dissolution of the current republican institutions.On the other side, reformists and merchants defend the current system of the Republican Caliphate. They argue that a balance of faith and representation has allowed for trade, prosperity, and fairness, warning that a theocracy could lead to rigidity and stagnation. \n\n§RThe fate of the Caliphate lies in your hands.§!"
